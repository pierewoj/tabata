# Tabata

This is a web browser app (single html file) that lets you execute a tabata based interval workout.

The app should let you start/pause/stop workout. There's only one hardcoded workout available.

During workout, the app should:
* display remaining time for each set
* have colorful background (switch from green to yellow between sets)
* have 5s rest between sets
* show excercise name, excercise index (for example 5/15) and remaining workout time
* the app should make noises when it's time to rest and time to start next set
* show name of the next excercise

The excercises/sets are as follows:
* L lydka - 1min
* R lydka - 1min
